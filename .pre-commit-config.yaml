    # Note that this is the 2nd "local" repo group in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file. This is because
    # we try to minimise the number of passes that must happen in order to apply some of the changes
    # done by pre-commits. Some of the pre-commits not only check for errors but also fix them. This means
    # that output from an earlier pre-commit becomes input to another pre-commit. Splitting the local
    # scripts of our and adding some other non-local pre-commit in-between allows us to handle such
    # changes quickly - especially when we want the early modifications from the first local group
    # to be applied before the non-local pre-commits are run
